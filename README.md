## Overview

DM Hero helps Dungeon Masters organize their D&D campaigns by solving the problem of scattered information across multiple documents. Quickly find NPCs, locations, items, and track relationships between entities with powerful fuzzy search.

### Key Features

- 🔍 **Universal Fuzzy Search** - Find entities even with typos using FTS5 + Levenshtein distance
- 🗺️ **Entity Management** - NPCs, Locations, Items, Factions, Quests, Sessions
- 🔗 **Relationship Tracking** - Link entities with typed relationships (e.g., "lives in", "works for")
- 📝 **Session Logs** - Track campaign timeline with entity mentions
- 🖼️ **Image Galleries** - Multiple images per entity with primary image selection
- 📄 **Markdown Documents** - Rich documentation with live preview
- 🌐 **i18n Support** - German and English localization
- 🎨 **Themed UI** - Dark (Midnight Tavern) and Light (Aged Parchment) themes

## Support the Project

DM Hero is completely **free and open source** - and always will be. I develop it in my spare time because I love D&D and want to help fellow Dungeon Masters run better campaigns.
