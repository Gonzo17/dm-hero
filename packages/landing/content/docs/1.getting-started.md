## First Launch

When you first open DM Hero, you'll see an empty dashboard. Let's fix that!

### Step 1: Create Your Campaign

1. Click the **+** button or **"New Campaign"**
2. Enter a name (e.g., "Curse of Strahd" or "My Homebrew World")
3. Optionally add a description
4. Click **Save**

Your campaign is now active and ready for content!

### Step 2: Add Your First NPC

NPCs are often the heart of any campaign. Let's create one:

1. Click **NPCs** in the sidebar
2. Click the **+** button
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Name**: The NPC's name (e.g., "Gandalf the Grey")
   - **Race**: Elf, Dwarf, Human, etc.
   - **Class**: Fighter, Wizard, Rogue, etc.
   - **Description**: Use Markdown for formatting!
4. Click **Save**

> **Pro Tip**: You can upload a portrait image or use the AI image generator!

### Step 3: Create a Location

Every NPC needs somewhere to be:

1. Click **Locations** in the sidebar
2. Click the **+** button
3. Enter:
   - **Name**: "The Prancing Pony"
   - **Type**: Tavern
   - **Description**: Describe the atmosphere, smells, sounds...
4. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Link Them Together

Here's where the magic happens! Let's say Gandalf frequents the tavern:

1. Open the NPC "Gandalf"
2. Go to the **Relations** tab
3. Click **Add Relation**
4. Select "The Prancing Pony" as the target
5. Set the relation type (e.g., "frequents" or "lives at")
6. Save

Now when you view either entity, you'll see they're connected!

## The Dashboard

Your dashboard shows:

- **Active Campaign**: Switch between campaigns easily
- **Recent Entities**: Quick access to recently viewed/edited items
- **Quick Stats**: How many NPCs, Locations, etc. you have
- **Recent Sessions**: Jump back into your session notes

---

## Navigation

### Sidebar

The sidebar gives you quick access to all entity types:

| Icon | Section | What it contains |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| 👤 | NPCs | Non-player characters |
| 📍 | Locations | Places in your world |
| ⚔️ | Items | Weapons, armor, artifacts |
| 🛡️ | Factions | Guilds, organizations, kingdoms |
| 📚 | Lore | World-building knowledge |
| 🎭 | Players | Your actual players and their characters |
| 📅 | Sessions | Game session notes and history |
| 🗺️ | Maps | Interactive campaign maps |

### Global Search

Press **`/`** (forward slash) anywhere to open the global search. Type anything and DM Hero will find it - even with typos!

---

## Tips for Success

### 1. Start Small

Don't try to document your entire world at once. Add entities as they become relevant in your sessions.

### 2. Use Entity Linking

In any description field, type `{{` to link to other entities:

```markdown
The {{npc:Gandalf}} was last seen at {{location:The Prancing Pony}}
carrying the {{item:Staff of Power}}.
```

These become clickable links with hover previews!

### 3. Add Images

Visual references help tremendously:
- Upload character portraits for NPCs
- Add maps for locations
- Include item illustrations

### 4. Use the Chaos Graph

Click the graph icon on any entity to see all its connections visualized. It's incredibly helpful for understanding how your world fits together.

### 5. Regular Backups

Your data is stored in a SQLite database. The file location:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/dm-hero/data/dm-hero.db`
- **Docker**: In your mounted volume

Copy this file periodically for backups!

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
