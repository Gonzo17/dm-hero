# Entity Types

DM Hero organizes your campaign into **seven entity types**. Each type has specific fields and features tailored to its purpose.

---

## NPCs (Non-Player Characters)

NPCs are the lifeblood of your campaign - the innkeepers, villains, quest givers, and mysterious strangers your players encounter.

### Fields

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Name** | The NPC's name | "Thorin Oakenshield" |
| **Race** | Species/ancestry | Dwarf, Elf, Human, Tiefling |
| **Class** | Profession/class | Fighter, Wizard, Merchant |
| **Alignment** | Moral compass | Lawful Good, Chaotic Neutral |
| **Status** | Current state | Alive, Dead, Unknown, Missing |
| **Description** | Rich text with Markdown | Personality, appearance, goals |

### Special Features

- **Multiple Images**: Upload several portraits (different expressions, ages)
- **Relations Tab**: Connect to other NPCs, Locations, Items, Factions
- **Items Tab**: Track what the NPC owns or carries
- **Locations Tab**: Where they can be found
- **Current Location**: Set their current whereabouts (syncs with maps!)

### Tips for Great NPCs

1. **Give them a quirk**: A verbal tic, a habit, a fear
2. **Define their goal**: What do they want? What's stopping them?
3. **Add a secret**: Something the players might discover
4. **Link relationships**: Who do they know? Who do they hate?

## Locations

From sprawling cities to cramped dungeon rooms, locations give your world geography.

### Fields

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Name** | Location name | "Waterdeep" |
| **Type** | Category | City, Dungeon, Tavern, Forest |
| **Parent Location** | Hierarchy | City → District → Building |
| **Description** | Sights, sounds, smells | The bustling market... |

### Hierarchy Example

```
Kingdom of Gondor
├── Minas Tirith (City)
│   ├── First Circle (District)
│   │   └── The Prancing Pony (Tavern)
│   └── Citadel (District)
└── Osgiliath (City)
```

### Special Features

- **Map Areas**: Mark locations as circles on your campaign maps
- **Nested Locations**: Create hierarchical structures
- **Related Entities**: See all NPCs, Items, etc. connected to this place

### Tips for Great Locations

1. **Engage all senses**: What do players see, hear, smell?
2. **Add NPCs**: Who lives/works here?
3. **Include secrets**: Hidden rooms, buried treasure, dark history
4. **Consider factions**: Who controls this area?

## Items

Magical artifacts, mundane equipment, plot MacGuffins - track them all.

### Fields

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|

### Special Features

- **Owner Relations**: Track who owns it, who owned it before

- **Multiple Images**: Show the item from different angles

### Tips for Great Items

1. **Give it history**: Who made it? Who died for it?
2. **Add quirks**: Does it glow? Whisper? Feel cold?
3. **Link to NPCs**: Who wants it? Who fears it?
4. **Consider consequences**: What happens when it's used?

---

## Factions

Guilds, kingdoms, cults, and organizations that shape your world's politics.

### Fields

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Name** | Faction name | "The Zhentarim" |

- **Current Location**: Primary base of operations

### Tips for Great Factions

1. **Define their goal**: World domination? Profit? Justice?

3. **Add ranks**: Initiate → Member → Leader
4. **Design symbols**: Flags, tattoos, secret handshakes

## Lore

World-building knowledge, history, religion, magic systems - the deep lore.

### Fields

### Tips for Great Lore

1. **Layer it**: Surface knowledge → Deep secrets
2. **Make it relevant**: Connect to current events
3. **Add unreliable narrators**: Different sources, different truths
4. **Keep it discoverable**: How will players learn this?

---

## Players

## Sessions

Chronicle your game sessions for posterity.

### Fields

### Tips

1. **Write summaries after each session**: While it's fresh
2. **Note player decisions**: For future consequences
3. **Track time**: Days passing matter!
4. **Link everything**: Who did they meet? Where did they go?

---

## Entity Relations

The real power of DM Hero is **connecting entities together**.

### Relation Types

You can create custom relation types, but here are common ones:

**NPC Relations**:
- ally, enemy, friend, rival, family, mentor, student

**Location Relations**:
- lives at, works at, owns, frequents, guards

**Item Relations**:
- owns, owned by, created by, seeks, guards

**Faction Relations**:
- member of, leader of, enemy of, allied with

### Bidirectional Links

When you link A to B, B automatically links back to A!

Example:
- "Gandalf" → "lives at" → "Bag End"
- "Bag End" automatically shows "Gandalf lives here"

### The Chaos Graph

Click the **graph icon** on any entity to visualize ALL its connections:

- **Center**: Your selected entity
- **Surrounding**: All connected entities
- **Lines**: Relationships
- **Hover**: See inter-connections between surrounding entities

It's called "Chaos" because complex worlds get beautifully chaotic!
