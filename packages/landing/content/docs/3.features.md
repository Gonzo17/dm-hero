# Features

DM Hero is packed with features to make your life as a Dungeon Master easier. Let's explore them all!

---

## Fuzzy Search

### The Problem

You're mid-session. A player asks "What was that NPC's name? The one in Baldur's Gate?" You know it's something like "Elminster" but you can't remember exactly...

### The Solution

Press **`/`** and type "Elminstr" - DM Hero finds "Elminster" even with your typo!

### How It Works

DM Hero uses **FTS5** (Full-Text Search 5) combined with **Levenshtein distance** matching:

- **FTS5**: Indexes all your content for instant retrieval
- **Levenshtein**: Measures how "close" your search is to actual names
- **Cross-Entity**: Searches NPCs, Locations, Items... everything!

### Search Tips

| What you type | What it finds |
|---------------|---------------|
| `gandlf` | Gandalf (typo tolerance) |
| `wizard elf` | All elven wizards |
| `"prancing pony"` | Exact phrase match |
| `tavern waterdeep` | Taverns in Waterdeep |

### Metadata Search

Search includes metadata fields too:

- Search "elf wizard" to find NPCs with race=Elf AND class=Wizard
- Search "legendary weapon" to find legendary rarity weapons
- Search "lawful good" to find all Lawful Good NPCs

---

## Entity Linking

### In-Text References

In any description field, create clickable links to other entities:

```markdown
The {{npc:Gandalf}} met with {{npc:Frodo}} at {{location:Bag End}}.
He carried the {{item:Staff of Power}} and spoke of {{lore:The Ring}}.
```

### How to Use

1. Type `{{` in any description field
2. Select the entity type: `npc`, `location`, `item`, `faction`, `lore`, `player`
3. Type the entity name
4. Close with `}}`

### What You Get

- **Clickable badges**: Click to navigate directly
- **Hover previews**: See entity details without leaving
- **Automatic updates**: If you rename an entity, links update too
- **Bidirectional awareness**: Linked entities know about each other

### Example Workflow

Writing about a location:

```markdown
## The Prancing Pony

A famous inn in {{location:Bree}}. The innkeeper {{npc:Barliman Butterbur}}
serves the best ale in the region.

Rumor has it that {{faction:The Rangers}} often meet here in secret,
and the {{item:Mysterious Map}} was last seen in the back room.
```

## Chaos Graph

### What Is It?

A visual representation of an entity's connections. Click the **graph icon** on any entity to see it.

### Reading the Graph

- **Center**: Your selected entity (highlighted)
- **Surrounding nodes**: Connected entities

### Why "Chaos"?

Because a well-developed campaign world looks beautifully chaotic! All those interconnected NPCs, locations, items, and factions create a web of relationships.

### Use Cases

2. **Improvisation**: Quickly find related NPCs mid-game
3. **World Building**: Discover gaps in your connections

## Tips & Tricks

### 1. Use Templates

Create a "Template NPC" with common fields filled in. Copy it when creating new NPCs.

### 2. Consistent Naming

Use consistent naming conventions:
- Locations: "The [Name]" or just "[Name]"
- NPCs: "Firstname Lastname" or "Nickname"
- Items: "The [Adjective] [Item]" for legendary items

### 3. Tag with Relations

Instead of tagging, use relations:
- Create a faction "Quest Givers"
- Add all quest-giving NPCs as members
- Now you can find them all easily!

### 4. Session Prep Workflow

1. Check the Chaos Graph for key NPCs
2. Review related locations
3. Note important items
4. Prepare faction movements

### 5. Post-Session Routine

1. Create a Session entry
2. Update NPC statuses (dead? moved?)
3. Update item locations (who has what now?)
4. Add new NPCs/locations encountered
